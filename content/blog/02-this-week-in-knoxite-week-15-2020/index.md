Hello and welcome from our (hopefully) weekly blog post reporting about the
latest changes happening all around the knoxite project.

The last week we achieved some cool changes we want to talk about:

## On the development-side of things...

 - We now have a WebDav-Backend, which also allows connecting to OwnCloud- and
   NextCloud-Instances thanks to @craftamap
 - We now have a Microsoft Azure File Storage Backend thanks to @mahartma
 - You now can use the `-c`/`--exclude` flag for restoring thanks to @penguwin
 - We now have a go-releaser config thanks to @muesli
 - And various other small changes/bugfixes thanks to @muesli

## On the "meta"-side of things...

Thanks to the effort of the whole team, we managed to jump-start our webpage
[knoxite.com](https://knoxite.com) within a few days.

It does not only contain the information about the project itself, we also put
up a "getting started"-guide.

From now on you can always find the current state of the
documentation on our website.

This should be everything for this week. Thanks for checking out this blogpost
and good bye!
