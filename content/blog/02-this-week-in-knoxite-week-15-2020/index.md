Hello and Welcome to our first ever weekly blog post about the latest
developments in the knoxite project.

There were a lot of exciting changes in the project this week:

## On the development side of things...

 - You can now use a WebDAV-backend, which also supports ownCloud and Nextcloud
   servers (by @craftamap)
 - We added a brand-new Microsoft Azure File Storage Backend (by @mahartma)
 - Restoring snapshots now supports the `-c` / `--exclude` flag (by @penguwin)
 - Binaries and packages are now created with go-releaser (by @muesli)
 - Various other small changes & bugfixes (by @muesli)

## On the "meta" side of things...

Thanks to the effort of the entire team, we managed to jump-start our webpage
[knoxite.com](https://knoxite.com). You're probably not surprised as you're
reading this blog post on it, aren't you?

Not only does it contain all kinds of information about the project itself, we
also put up a [Getting Started](https://knoxite.com/docs/getting-started/)
guide. Check it out and start backing up your data safely and reliably with
knoxite! No more excuses!

We're also continuously working on improving our [documentation](https://knoxite.com/docs/).
Looking for help and can't find the information in the docs? Join us in the
[chat](https://gitter.im/knoxite/chat) and let us know!

That's it for this week!
