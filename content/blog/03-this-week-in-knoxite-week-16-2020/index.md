A warm welcome from your knoxite team in this blogpost reporting about the 
progress we did in week 16 of 2020.

As last week, we will start off with the...

## development side of knoxite!

As new features we have a new backend serving the google cloud storage thanks
to @mahartma.

We also spent a lot of time for tests this week. The whole team spent time 
writing tests for our backends.
Thanks to the big effort of @muesli, we also switched from `Travis CI` to 
`GitHub Actions`.

## On the "meta"-side of things...

We did a lot of small changes on our website and our documentation.
On the website, we added a lightbox for our images (thanks to @craftamap).

Thanks to the whole team (huge shoutout to @penguwin) for updating the 
documentation as well as the "getting started"-guide.

If you want to get the latest news of our development "live", you can also join
our IRC-Channel, where you can read the events happening on our repositories. 
Thanks @penguwin for creating the `knoxitebee`, a 
[beehive bee](https://github.com/muesli/beehive).


Thats it for this week! Stay tuned for the next post of our weekly blogpost!
